Παρις κατα γαστρὸς ἔχουσα ἡ Ἐκάβη ὄναρ ἐθεάσατο. ὅτι ἔτεκεν δαλὸν ὑφ οὗ πᾶσα κατεφλέχθη ἡ πόλις· τὸ οὖν τεχθὲν οὐ γνώμη τῶν μάντεων ἐξετέθη ἀλλα γνώμη θεῶν ὑπο τοῦ εὑρόντος ἐτράφη βουκόλου. ὃς ἄρκτον αὐτῷ γάλα ἐπισχοῦσαν θεασάμενος ἀνέθρεψεν. ἐκλήθη οὖν Πάρις οὐχ ὥς τινες φασὶν ἐν πήρᾳ ἐτράφη ἀλλ ὅτι τὸν μόρον παρῆλθεν. ὕστερον δὲ Αλέξανδρος. ὅτι τῇ πατρίδι ἠξηλέησεν ὅ ἐστιν ἐβοήθησε πολεμίων ἐπελθόντων.

#Scribal Differences#

There is a common source from which Scribe A (Venetus A) and Scribe B (Venetus B) derived their information, but made editorial decisions when they wrote their scholia. By examining textual Examples between the two manuscripts we can glimpse into the role the scribe plays when composing scholia.

- myth only, no etymology
- clarifies that he is both Paris and Alexander
- expands Hecuba's dream to say that the firebrand will also burn down the forest on Mt. Ida.
- explicitly says that the seers wanted him killed by throwing him to wild beasts
- Names the shepherd who raises Paris as Archialas and cites Porphurios as the source.
