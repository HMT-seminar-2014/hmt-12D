#Scribal Variance#

There is a common source--scholia D--from which Scribe A (Venetus A) and Scribe B (Venetus B) derived their information, but made editorial decisions when they wrote their scholia. By examining textual variants between the two manuscripts we can glimpse into the role the scribe plays when composing scholia.

- myth only, no etymology
- clarifies that he is both Paris and Alexander

- explicitly says that the seers wanted him killed by throwing him to wild beasts
- Names the shepherd who raises Paris as Archialas and cites Porphurios as the source.
